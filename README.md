# Wine Helper

An app that educates viewers about wine, helps them explore new wines, 
and educates them on the impacts of climate change on grape yield.
=======

This app contains 4 pages: an introduction for the user about wine and 
grape growing, an interactive world map of the highest rated wines, 
an interactive function to explore new wines by type and flavor, 
and a graph showing how global temperatures have impacted grape yield 
over the past few years.
