The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened.

Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6‚Äì8 years.

51896,Italy,"Costa Grimaldi is a spectacular wine that surprises with every sip thanks to its intensity and the extraordinary quality of its mouthfeel. Initially, the wine is soft and yielding with tones of red cherry, chocolate, cola, licorice and mineral. It grows even more opulent and velvety in the mouth thanks to its fine texture and tannins.

51898,US,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance.

51899,US,"An extraordinary Cabernet that stands out even in this great vintage, and among its Rutherford peers. Quite dry and tannic in youth, it shows an astringency that strongly suggests the cellar. Underneath are powerhouse flavors of blackberries, black and red cherries, spices, tea and cedar. Really defines balance and elegance in a Napa Cabernet.

The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance.

92933,US,"This wine is light on the palate, almost airy. The official alcohol reading is under 14%. Yet it packs the power of the world's greatest reds. Wild cherries and raspberries, with impossibly complex mocha, cola, anise, cinnamon and other flavors impossible to describe but endlessly fascinating. Gorgeous now, and should evolve for at least six years.",Precious Mountain Vineyard,96,90,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem,36.778261,-119.4179324
92948,France,"Expressive fruit aromas and wood perfumes announce this wine. With 94% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a complex wine marked by purity of black fruits, berries, toast and tannins. It has power, richness and a lovely edge of spice to go with the acidity. The wine is firmly structured, while bursting with fruit and freshness.",,96,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch√¢teau Latour,44.837789,-0.57918
92949,France,"A rich wine, opulent in character. There is power here, with richness of fruit and texture. It is both serious side and exuberant, with its bursting black berry fruits.",,96,,Bordeaux,Pauillac,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild,44.837789,-0.57918
92950,France,"Dark, dusty, hugely structured, Haut-Brion is a complex, serious wine with grandeur. The wine has considerable weight, its tannins striated through the black plum and damson skin fruits. For long-term aging.",,96,,Bordeaux,Pessac-L√©ognan,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion,44.837789,-0.57918
92951,France,"Definite richness alongside classic elegance. It's a stylish wine, the fruit integrated into a beautiful structure. It's not all refinement, because there is also a weight to the black plum skin and dark berry character. A wine that will age over many decades.",,96,,Bordeaux,Margaux,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch√¢teau Margaux,44.837789,-0.57918
92952,Italy,"Poggio Nardone offers an absolutely gorgeous Brunello with incredibly smooth, rich and beautiful aromas of mature blackberry, coffee, tobacco and smoky barbecue sauce. The wine's texture is dense but also silky and the fruit-driven finish lasts many minutes.",,96,50,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Sangiovese Grosso,Poggio Nardone,43.7710513,11.2486208
92953,France,"A dense, beautifully structured wine. It shows intense, ripe fruit with balanced acidity. It's the fine tannins that give it such class, surrounding the fruit, promising long aging. This is a classic for L√©oville-Barton.",,96,90,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ch√¢teau L√©oville Barton,44.837789,-0.57918
94524,US,"Hard mountain tannins characterize this Cab, which was grown above 2,000 feet in the Mayacamas. It's hugely deep in blackberries and black currants, with notes of dark chocolate and violets. Meanwhile, 100% new French oak adds an elaborate layer of smoky caramel and char that's entirely in keeping with the wine's volume. Impressive and flashy, but immature, this wine requires cellaring. Best 2012‚Äì2018.",Christopher's,96,100,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stonestreet,36.778261,-119.4179324
94525,US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",,96,75,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Legacy,36.778261,-119.4179324
94526,US,"This feels slightly softer in the mouth than the massive 2006, but carries the density and gravitas that one associates with Quilceda Creek. Wonderful balance, with a deeply detailed set of flavors that gather strength as they move through the palate. Mixed berries, threaded with chocolate, lingering with black cherry, cassis, smoke, cedar, lead pencil and more.",,96,125,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quilceda Creek,47.7510741,-120.7401385
94922,US,"Filled with black and red berries and stone fruits that have a smoky, grilled edge, this dramatic Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from several great vineyards, mainly Stagecoach, which is up on Atlas Peak. It drinks well now at the age of four-plus years, showing lush fruit that's just beginning to dry out and achieve bottle bouquet. Feels sweet and soft in the mouth. A compelling, complex and nuanced wine of great elegance and allure.",Stature,96,120,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Kendall-Jackson,36.778261,-119.4179324
94923,France,"A gold-colored wine. The palate has intense freshness as well as ripe apricot and orange zest flavors. The acidity cuts through the intense richness, leaving a wine that needs time to fully integrate, and then many more years to mature.",,96,,Bordeaux,Sauternes,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Ch√¢teau Guiraud,44.837789,-0.57918
94924,US,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins. Finishes sweet but completely dry, the paradox of a great wine.

94925,Spain,"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.",Malleolus de Sanchomartin,96,204,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Emilio Moro,42.817034,-1.6416672
96770,US,"Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.",Precioso,96,150,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Pinot Noir,Keller Estate,36.778261,-119.4179324
98442,US,"Astonishingly rich, this is everything you want a Chardonnay to be. It's fantastically concentrated in pineapple, guava, green apple, pear and lime fruits; it's creamy and suave in lees influence; and it's brisk in acidity, despite undergoing malolactic fermentation. The texture is honeyed, with a perfect touch of smoky, new French oak. The estate grapes come from the winery's vineyard high up in the Vaca Mountains, east of the Silverado Trail.",Finch Hollow Estate Grown Cave Fermented Unfiltered,96,115,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Chardonnay,Jarvis,36.778261,-119.4179324
98443,US,"This is so charming now, it's hard to keep from drinking it. But it also has the dynamic tension to age well. Chimney Rock enters a whole new ballgame with its 2009 releases, which can stand against almost anything in Napa Valley. With a fleshy mouthfeel, softly sculpted tannins and complex flavors of blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and plum sauce, this wine is decadently delicious.
